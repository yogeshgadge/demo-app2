# DemoApp2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

This is to demo that the following does not work and build fails.

```sass
$fa-font-path: "~font-awesome/fonts" !default;
@import "~font-awesome/scss/font-awesome";
```


## Build Fails

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
